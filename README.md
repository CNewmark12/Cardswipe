## In-Depth Explanation
This program is to be used with the [MSR90 card swipe](https://www.amazon.com/MSR90-Magnetic-Credit-Reader-Deftun/dp/B01DUB4GVO/ref=sr_1_3?crid=WQ0TEUDW41LP&keywords=card+swipe&qid=1649191097&sprefix=card+swipe%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-3 "MSR90 on Amazon"). It opens a GUI that tracks the ID card number and time for swiping in and out. Once the GUI is closed, it saves the information to a csv file. There is also the option to manually type in the card number. Because of the usage for my particular location, the program only accepts ID numbers in between 2 and 7 digits long - so you may need to change that. Finally, the python file should be built to an .exe file.
